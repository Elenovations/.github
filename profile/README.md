## Hi there 👋

Hier, we are analyzing earth magnetic fields data from different stations using various data analysis and ML methods. The existing repos are as follow:
- Elenovations.github.io: The source of our website which contains the visualizations of results.
- observatory-data-storage: The most of our scripts can be found here. We need to clean and document it.
